# React Init Project - ReactJS 18 + TypeScript + ViteJS
I created this repository to minimize the time it takes to start a new project.

In this source code I have included settings related to eslint, prettier, create hooks 
for fetching data using axios, and also demo for unit testing. Besides, I also did some config to support our team work smoother with husky library.
